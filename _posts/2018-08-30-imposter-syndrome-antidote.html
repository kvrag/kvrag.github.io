<p>Last August, I graduated from Dev Bootcamp (RIP) and was, to my surprise and delight, hired to stay on as a student mentor. I could give back to the organization! I could stave off the impending doom of unemployment! I could work part-time for a livable wage and still have the energy to apply to full-time jobs! Yay!</p>

<p>The Monday after I graduated, I started mentoring, and a feeling of deep unease replaced all that happy energy. I was suddenly in a position of relative authority, after having been a student myself just a few days prior. I didn’t know if I was ready. I didn’t know if I could actually help anyone learn to code. After all, I was still learning. What did I have to offer? Who did I think I was?</p>

<p>Turns out, this feeling hasn’t really gone away even after getting a Real Job and being a Real Developer for a while. (Side note: <a href=“http://amiarealdeveloper.com/“>Click here to find out if you’re a Real Developer.</a> Congrats.)</p>

<p>Puh-lenty of articles have been written about imposter syndrome, so I won’t take the time to dissect the whys and wherefores here. I just want to write a letter to my DBC-graduate self, and maybe look back on it when I’m feeling imposter-y.</p>

    <p>Yo, self,</p>

    <p>Hello there. It’s the future. I promise, everything will be fine. Here are all of the reasons why. Don’t cry, you’re fine. Or cry if you want to, because completing the stress cycle is important.</p>
