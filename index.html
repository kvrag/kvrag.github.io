            <strong>From publishing to marketing to web development,</strong> my career has been a journey of considering great ideas from authors, teams, and peers and helping them come to&nbsp;life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went from writer/editor to professional React/Rails developer in less than a year. Changing careers taught me how far Iâ€™m willing to push myself to feel challenged by my work and take accountability for my own happiness and growth. I learned how to have fun while learning, expose my ignorance, and speak my truth. Today I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of my expertise and helping to raise the voices of underrepresented folks in tech.

            <strong>Currently, I work at <a href="http://www.homechef.com">Home Chef</a>,</strong> a Chicago-based meal kit company that, in partnership with Kroger, is expanding into the retail grocery space. I help build the internal applications that our Culinary and Customer Support teams use to design new meals and address customer concerns. I like that I get to work on a truly diverse team that delivers thoughtful solutions to our stakeholders. In my spare time, I sing in two choirs and snuggle my cats.
