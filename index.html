            <strong>From publishing to marketing to web development,</strong> my career has been a journey of considering great ideas from authors, teams, and peers and helping them come to&nbsp;life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went from writer/editor to professional React/Rails developer in less than a year. Changing careers taught me how far Iâ€™m willing to push myself to feel challenged by my work and take accountability for my own happiness and growth. I learned how to have fun while learning, expose my ignorance, and speak my truth. Today I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of my expertise by expanding into the mobile development space&nbsp;&mdash; and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Currently, I work at <a href="http://www.20spokes.com">20spokes</a>,</strong> a Chicago software consultancy, where I build greenfield apps for clients across industries and across platforms and also work on project maintenance. I like that I get to work with people who enjoy challenging the "way things are done." In my spare time, I sing in two choirs and snuggle my cats.
