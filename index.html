    <p class="intro">
        <strong>From publishing to marketing to web development,</strong> my career has been a journey of considering great ideas
        from authors, teams, and peers and helping them come to&nbsp;life.</p>

    <p>In my next role, I seek to leverage my web development and communication skills to create interactive user experiences
        across platforms. I'm best motivated by an inclusive, high-energy team environment that fosters curiosity and&nbsp;growth.â€‹
